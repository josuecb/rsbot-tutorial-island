# Tutorial Island 0.2v

This is my first rsbot-script I really wanted to make this script to learn and to use it by myself since there is no good tutorial island script out there,
some times, developers takes ages to update it.
I am a very active developer, any questions or so I will make immediate updates or bug-fixes.

I will try to do my best to respond back on time. I will make this scrip available ASAP. 

### Change Log
- Added a GUI to add username.

## Features
- For now it does everything the script needs, the only things is that it doesn't stop but detects where it is in the island.
- If the script gets stuck, just make sure to stop and re-run it for now and let me know what kind of bug you are getting.


I will be working on next versions and improvements of this script while I am learning more about the API and get more experience writing scripts.
